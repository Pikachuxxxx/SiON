SiON -- cppPort Branch
====
The SiON (pronounced as “scion”) is an ActionScript3 software synthesizer library.

**This branch is an experiment to port the SiON Library to C++. By doing so we can make our beloved (BoscaCeoil)[https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/boscaceoil] serve for millions of years.**

SiON provides a simple sound synchronization with DisplayObject and an easy dynamic sound generation. You can generate various sounds without any mp3 files and wave data.The musical sequence is represented as Music Macro Language (a simple text data) or Standard MIDI Files. It makes your sounding SWF file very very small.
